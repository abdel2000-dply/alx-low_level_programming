# Search Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing and understanding search algorithms. Search algorithms are essential tools in computer science that enable the efficient retrieval of specific elements from a collection of data. In this project, we explore two fundamental search algorithms: linear search and binary search.
## What are Search Algorithms?

Search algorithms are step-by-step procedures used to locate specific items within a collection of data, playing a crucial role in information retrieval.

## Linear Search

**Definition:** Simple algorithm iterating through each element until a match is found or the end is reached.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Linear time, suitable for small, unsorted datasets.

## Binary Search

**Definition:** Efficient algorithm for sorted collections, repeatedly dividing the search space.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) - Logarithmic time, ideal for large, sorted datasets.

## Choosing the Best Algorithm

- **Data Characteristics:** Linear for small, unsorted; Binary for large, sorted.
